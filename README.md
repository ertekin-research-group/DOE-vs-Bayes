# DOE-vs-Bayes
tutorial exercises of optimization using Design of Experiments (DOE) vs Bayesian Optimization.  

For the tutorial on Bayesian Optimization, I have liberally borrowed 
[from this example](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-bayesian-optimization/) 
from the Machine Learning Mastering Blog by Jason Brownlee.
