    "# Machine Learning for SEM Image Segmentation in Materials Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are typically used to observe the growth results of a synthesis experiment, such as areal coverage, nucleation density, and the shape, size, and quality of graphene domains. While the visual inspection of images can sometimes be sufficient to determine the quality of graphene, it is desirable to determine quantitative metrics as well. Quantitative metrics can provide for easier comparison between experimental results and are useful as response variables when attempting to predict optimal recipes. To calculate these metrics, we need to segment the image and each pixel needs to be classified as 'graphene' or 'not-graphene'. \n",
